    abstract = {1. Antibodies to slime molds were produced by injecting D. discoideum and D. purpureum amebas from 48 hour cultures into rabbits. 2. Anti-D. discoideum and anti-D. purpureum sera caused agglutination of homologous amebas from 24 to 26 hour cultures, agglutination of certain heterologous amebas from 30 to 36 hour cultures, and agglutination of all heterologous amebas from 43 to 48 hour cultures. 3. The data show that new surface antigens are formed in cultures after 26 hours and it is suggested that the new antigens are concerned with cell adhesion. 4. The probable role of surface antigens in the interaction of cells of different species of slime molds was discussed.},

    abstract = {Cellular slime molds have been classified on the basis of a small number of descriptive criteria such as fruiting body color and morphology, and, in heterothallic species, by assignment to compatible mating groups. However, some isolates which are morphologically classified as conspecific do not fall into a simple mating-type classification; for example some are asexual or homothallic. An increasing interest in inter-strain genetic variation in studies of development and simple behavior has led us to reassess genetic relationships among a number of frequently used isolates. Allozyme electrophoresis of 16 soluble enzymes and use of a monoclonal antibody show that there is relatively little genetic diversity among sexually competent Dictyostelium discoideum isolates, despite considerable variation in geographic origin and time since isolation in the laboratory. In contrast a pair of asexual strains and each of two homothallic strains are genetically quite distinct and differ sufficiently from each other, and from sexually competent isolates, to warrant their recognition as separate species. There are probably four biological species represented in the supposedly D. discoideum isolates studied. This heterogeneity extends to other cellular slime mold species. Each of three isolates of Dictyostelium purpureum is genetically distinct from the others. Limited analysis of other cellular slime molds indicates that the generic distinction of Dictyostelium and Polysphondylium must be questioned. This study emphasizes that caution should be applied in classifying simple organisms on morphological criteria.},
