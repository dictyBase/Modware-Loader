    abstract = {1. Antibodies to slime molds were produced by injecting D. discoideum and D. purpureum amebas from 48 hour cultures into rabbits. 2. Anti-D. discoideum and anti-D. purpureum sera caused agglutination of homologous amebas from 24 to 26 hour cultures, agglutination of certain heterologous amebas from 30 to 36 hour cultures, and agglutination of all heterologous amebas from 43 to 48 hour cultures. 3. The data show that new surface antigens are formed in cultures after 26 hours and it is suggested that the new antigens are concerned with cell adhesion. 4. The probable role of surface antigens in the interaction of cells of different species of slime molds was discussed.},

abstract = {Dictyostelium constitutes a genetically tractable model for the analysis of autophagic cell death (ACD). During ACD, Dictyostelium cells first transform into paddle cells and then become round, synthesize cellulose, vacuolize, and die. Through random insertional mutagenesis, we identified the receptor histidine kinase DhkM as being essential for ACD. Surprisingly, different DhkM mutants showed distinct nonvacuolizing ACD phenotypes. One class of mutants arrested ACD at the paddle cell stage, perhaps through a dominant-negative effect. Other mutants, however, progressed further in the ACD program. They underwent rounding and cellulose synthesis but stopped before vacuolization. Moreover, they underwent clonogenic but not morphological cell death. Exogenous 8-bromo-cAMP restored vacuolization and death. A role for a membrane receptor at a late stage of the ACD pathway is puzzling, raising questions as to which ligand it is a receptor for and which moieties it phosphorylates. Together, DhkM is the most downstream-known molecule required for this model ACD, and its distinct mutants genetically separate previously undissociated late cell death events.}

abstract = {In response to directional stimulation by a chemoattractant, cells rapidly activate a series of signaling pathways at the site closest to the chemoattractant source that leads to F-actin polymerization, pseudopod formation, and directional movement up the gradient. Ras proteins are major regulators of chemotaxis in Dictyostelium; they are activated at the leading edge, are required for chemoattractant-mediated activation of PI3K and TORC2, and are one of the most rapid responders, with activity peaking at approximately 3 s after stimulation. We demonstrate that in myosin II (MyoII) null cells, Ras activation is highly extended and is not restricted to the site closest to the chemoattractant source. This causes elevated, extended, and spatially misregulated activation of PI3K and TORC2 and their effectors Akt/PKB and PKBR1, as well as elevated F-actin polymerization. We further demonstrate that disruption of specific IQGAP/cortexillin complexes, which also regulate cortical mechanics, causes extended activation of PI3K and Akt/PKB but not Ras activation. Our findings suggest that MyoII and IQGAP/cortexillin play key roles in spatially and temporally regulating leading-edge activity and, through this, the ability of cells to restrict the site of pseudopod formation.}

abstract = {<a href="http://www.geneontology.org">Gene Ontology</a> (GO) annotations with the evidence code 'Inferred by Curator' are assigned manually to gene products in dictyBase. Sometimes, an annotation can be inferred by a curator based on another annotation even though there is no supporting evidence. For example, the cellular component "nucleus" can be implied from an annotation to "transcription factor activity", even if the gene product has not been experimentally observed in the nucleus. In such a case, the evidence code IC (Inferred by Curator) is used.  (Example from the <a href="http://www.geneontology.org/GO.evidence.shtml?all">GO Annotation Guide</a>.)}
