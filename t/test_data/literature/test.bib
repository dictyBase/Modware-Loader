abstract = {Genetic analysis has implicated the cell surface glycoprotein gp130 in cell interactions of the social amoeba Dictyostelium, and information about the utilization of the 18 N-glycosylation sequons present in gp130 is needed to identify critical molecular determinants of its activity. Various glycomics strategies, including mass spectrometry of native and derivatized glycans, monosaccharide analysis, exoglycosidase digestion, and antibody binding, were applied to characterize a nonanchored version secreted from Dictyostelium. s-gp130 is modified by a predominant Man(8)GlcNAc(4) species containing bisecting and intersecting GlcNAc residues and additional high-mannose N-glycans substituted with sulfate, methyl-phosphate, and/or core alpha 3-fucose. Site mapping confirmed the occupancy of 15 sequons, some variably, and glycopeptide analysis confirmed 14 sites and revealed extensive heterogeneity at most sites. Glycopeptide glycoforms ranged from Man(6) to Man(9), GlcNAc(0-2) (peripheral), Fuc(0-2) (including core alpha 3 and peripheral), (SO(4))(0-1), and (MePO(4))(0-1), which represented elements of virtually the entire known cellular N-glycome as inferred from prior metabolic labeling and mass spectrometry studies. gp130, and a family of 14 related predicted glycoproteins whose polypeptide sequences are rapidly diverging in the Dictyostelium lineage, may contribute a functionally important shroud of high-mannose N-glycans at the interface of the amoebae with each other, their predators and prey, and the soil environment.},

abstract = {<a href="http://www.geneontology.org">Gene Ontology</a> (GO) annotations with the evidence code 'Inferred by Curator' are assigned manually to gene products in dictyBase. Sometimes, an annotation can be inferred by a curator based on another annotation even though there is no supporting evidence. For example, the cellular component "nucleus" can be implied from an annotation to "transcription factor activity", even if the gene product has not been experimentally observed in the nucleus. In such a case, the evidence code IC (Inferred by Curator) is used.  (Example from the <a href="http://www.geneontology.org/GO.evidence.shtml?all">GO Annotation Guide</a>.)},

In contrast however, UniProtKB keywords are automatically assigned to UniProtKB/TrEMBL entries from the underlying nucleic acid databases and/or by the UniProt automatic annotation program.<br>Further information on the two different UniProt annotation methods is available at http://www.uniprot.org/faq/45 and http://www.uniprot.org/program/automatic_annotation .<br>When a UniProtKB keyword describes a concept that is within the scope of the Gene Ontology, it is investigated to determine whether it is appropriate to map the keyword to an equivalent term in GO. The mapping between UniProtKB keywords and GO terms is carried out manually. Definitions and hierarchies of the terms in the two resources are compared and the mapping generated will reflect the most correct correspondence.

abstract = {Greater size and strength are common attributes of contest winners. Even in social insects with high cooperation, the right to reproduce falls to the well-fed queens rather than to poorly fed workers. In Dictyostelium discoideum, formerly solitary amoebae aggregate when faced with starvation, and some cells die to form a stalk which others ride up to reach a better location to sporulate. The first cells to starve have lower energy reserves than those that starve later, and previous studies have shown that the better-fed cells in a mix tend to form disproportionately more reproductive spores. Therefore, one might expect that the first cells to starve and initiate the social stage should act altruistically and form disproportionately more of the sterile stalk, thereby enticing other better-fed cells into joining the aggregate. This would resemble caste determination in social insects, where altruistic workers are typically fed less than reproductive queens. However, we show that the opposite result holds: the first cells to starve become reproductive spores, presumably by gearing up for competition and outcompeting late starvers to become prespore first. These findings pose the interesting question of why others would join selfish organizers.},
