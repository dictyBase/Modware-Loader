    abstract = {1. Antibodies to slime molds were produced by injecting D. discoideum and D. purpureum amebas from 48 hour cultures into rabbits. 2. Anti-D. discoideum and anti-D. purpureum sera caused agglutination of homologous amebas from 24 to 26 hour cultures, agglutination of certain heterologous amebas from 30 to 36 hour cultures, and agglutination of all heterologous amebas from 43 to 48 hour cultures. 3. The data show that new surface antigens are formed in cultures after 26 hours and it is suggested that the new antigens are concerned with cell adhesion. 4. The probable role of surface antigens in the interaction of cells of different species of slime molds was discussed.},

abstract = {Transitive assignments using UniProtKB keywords. The UniProtKB keyword controlled vocabulary has been created and used by the UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB) to supply 10 different categories of information to UniProtKB entries. Further information on the UniProtKB keyword resource can be found at http://www.uniprot.org/docs/keywlist<br>UniProtKB keywords are assigned to UniProtKB/UniProtKB entries by UniProt curators as part of the UniProtKB manual curation process. In contrast however, UniProtKB keywords are automatically assigned to UniProtKB/TrEMBL entries from the underlying nucleic acid databases and/or by the UniProt automatic annotation program.<br>Further information on the two different UniProt annotation methods is available at http://www.uniprot.org/faq/45 and http://www.uniprot.org/program/automatic_annotation .<br>When a UniProtKB keyword describes a concept that is within the scope of the Gene Ontology, it is investigated to determine whether it is appropriate to map the keyword to an equivalent term in GO. The mapping between UniProtKB keywords and GO terms is carried out manually. Definitions and hierarchies of the terms in the two resources are compared and the mapping generated will reflect the most correct correspondence. The translation table between GO terms and UniProtKB keywords is maintained by the UniProt-GOA team and available at http://www.geneontology.org/external2go/uniprotkb_kw2go .}
