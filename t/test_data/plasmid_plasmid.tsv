DBP0000045	pMB38	Extrachromosomal response plasmid containing the inducible promoter TRE-P<sub>min</sub> upstream of the 2H3T terminator with 4 unique restriction sites in between.    Both tetON and tetOFF systems exist for Dicty. The tetOFF system was pioneered by Dingermann and colleagues, but the most frequently used  vectors are those constructed by Blaauw et al., Gene 252:71-82, 2000.  The Dicty tetON system is derived from yeast vectors described in Urlinger  et al., PNAS 97:7963-8, 2000; the rtTa-M2 element from ? was recloned into the Blaauw vector MB35 by Adriano Ceccarelli, and students in my lab have shown that the performance of this tetON system in Dicty (induction  factor, response time) is similar to that of the tetOFF system.    Both the original tetOFF MB35 and its tetON version are neo vectors. In practice one needs a Dicty strain carrying one or the other of these, which one overtransforms with a second, blasticidin vector (Blauuw et al. MB38) carrying the gene of interest. Once one has cloned one's gene into MB38, it can be overtransformed into both tetON and tetOFF strains. Both MB35 and MB38 are in the stock center, as are cells containing MB35. H. MacWilliams

DBP0000118	pVEII	inducible gene expression vector containing the discoidin gamma promoter; constructed by replacing the act6 promoter in pDnNeo2. <br/><br/> Transformation vector which can be used for expression of genes from the discoidin I gamma promoter. The vector contains a multiple cloning site for inserting the gene of interest. The discoidin ATG is located upstream of the MCS. We recommend sequencing the junction of the insert using a primer within the promoter. The oligo: 5'-GAA AAA TTA AAA TTT CAT ACA AAT TAT C-3' worked well for us; you can start reading at the ATG - XbaI site.  <br/><br/>  Regulation of the promoter is described in Vauti et al., Mol. Cell. BioI. 8, 4080-4088, 1990. The paper by Blusch et al., Nucl. Acids Res. 20, 6235-6238, 1992 describes use of pVEII as an inducible expression system. This has now been working for several people (e.g. M. Clarke, G. Weeks). In addition, Dictyostelium cells with altered discoidin expression can be used to get higher or lower expression. These mutant strains can be obtained from B. Wetterauer and H. MacWilliams (PMID 8464730 and PMID 8396055). <b> Sequence note: </b> This sequence has been provided by Piero Morandini and Klaus Salger.
