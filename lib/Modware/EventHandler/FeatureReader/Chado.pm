=for author to fill in:
Write a separate section listing the public components of the modules
interface. These normally consist of either subroutines that may be
exported, or methods that may be called on objects belonging to the
classes provided by the module.

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

=for author to fill in:
A full explanation of any configuration system(s) used by the
module, including the names and locations of any configuration
files, and the meaning of any environment variables or properties
that can be set. These descriptions must also include details of any
configuration language used.

<MODULE NAME> requires no configuration files or environment variables.


=head1 DEPENDENCIES

=for author to fill in:
A list of all the other modules that this module relies upon,
  including any restrictions on versions, and an indication whether
  the module is part of the standard Perl distribution, part of the
  module's distribution, or must be installed separately. ]

  None.


  =head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

  =for author to fill in:
  A list of any modules that this module cannot be used in conjunction
  with. This may be due to name conflicts in the interface, or
  competition for system or program resources, or due to internal
  limitations of Perl (for example, many modules that use source code
		  filters are mutually incompatible).

  None reported.


  =head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

  =for author to fill in:
  A list of known problems with the module, together with some
  indication Whether they are likely to be fixed in an upcoming
  release. Also a list of restrictions on the features the module
  does provide: data types that cannot be handled, performance issues
  and the circumstances in which they may arise, practical
  limitations on the size of data sets, special cases that are not
  (yet) handled, etc.
